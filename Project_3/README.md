## Project 3: Landmark Detection
In this project, I implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world!
this was done by combining robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.
 
SLAM enables tracking the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identifying the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
